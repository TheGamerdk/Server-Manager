For starting the player out I was thinking of a 160gb WD Blue.
250GB WD blue drive $20-$25, Great quality, but costs more.
250GB Offbrand drive $10-$15, Low price but has a high failure rate.
250GB Seagate drive $25-$30, A high price, but it is almost impossible to fail.
500GB WD blue drive $30-$38, Great quality, but costs more.
500GB Offbrand drive $20-$25, Low price but has a high failure rate.
500GB Seagate dirve $40-$45, A high price, but it is almost impossible to fail.
1TB WD Blue drive $50-$60, Great quality, but costs more.
1TB Offbrand dirve $35-$45, Low price but has a high failure rate.
1TB Seagate drive $70-$80, A high price, but it is almost impossible to fail.
