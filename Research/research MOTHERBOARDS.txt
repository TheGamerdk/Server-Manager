First of, there are quite a few different form factors for Motherboards.
An extract from a Wikipdia article states:
<< 
As of 2007, most desktop computer motherboards use the ATX standard form factor
â€” even those found in Macintosh and Sun computers, which have not been built from commodity components.
A case's motherboard and PSU form factor must all match,
though some smaller form factor motherboards of the same family will fit larger cases.
For example, an ATX case will usually accommodate a microATX motherboard.

So we have
 Standart-ATX[305x244mm], wich is the largest common form factor
 Micro-ATX[244x244mm], wich is the 2nd largest common form factor
 Mini-ITX[170x170mm], wich is the largest ITX form factor
 Nano-ITX[120x120mm], wich is the 2nd largest ITX form factor
 Pico-ITX[100x72mm],wich is the 2nd smallest ITX form factor
 
 And now to the sockets.
