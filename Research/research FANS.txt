Standard case fans are 80, 92, 120, 140, 200 and 230 mm in width and length.( CPU Fans )
There are 2 common gpu fan types:
Turbines (wich are pretty much stock fans for most of the newer gpus)
 
And "Blowers"( wich are mostly aftermarket fans on aftermarket gpus. they do exist howerver on older gpus like the 750(ti) for example)
                                 


Turbine fans dissipate heat out the back of the case over a dense fin array/vapor chamber in the plastic housing and are generally noisier than aftermarket fans

Blowers however have a more "standad"-like designe with fans you could also see on cpu coolers. 
Single-Fan coolers either push or pull air trough the heatsink.
Dual-Fan coolers mostly have a Push-Pull configuration in wich 1 will push and 1 will pull air trough the heatsink.
Sometimes the heatsink is closed on dual fan designes wich means that the air has a set path that it takes trough the heatsink and doesnt leak, 
wich creates a static pressure in wich no dust can settle.
